## Course Structure Overview

This course is divided into two main parts:

### 1. Theory (Notes PDFs)

- **`python-notes-early.pdf`** and **`python-notes-later.pdf`** contain the theoretical materials.
- The theory covers Python fundamentals and intermediate topics **up to (but not including) the "Network Scripting (Optional but Powerful)" section**.
- From the **Network Scripting** section onward, theory is intentionally **excluded** to emphasize hands-on practice.

### 2. Practice (Practical Folder)

- All hands-on exercises and scripts reside inside the existing `practical/` folder, which includes:
  - `labs/` — practical exercises and hands-on labs  
  - `tools/` — Python scripts and utility tools for practice
