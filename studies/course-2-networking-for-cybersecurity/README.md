## üí° About the Notes

Some topics may appear repetitive, especially in the initial overview,  
because I learned them at different times. Cisco tends to dive deep  
into networking topics‚Äîoften targeting those pursuing roles like  
**network administrators** or **network engineers**.

I selected the skills and concepts that I felt were most relevant to  
**cybersecurity**, but I encourage you to explore Cisco's materials  
yourself‚Äîyou might find something valuable that I didn't include.
