# Cybersec-Pro-Archive

Welcome to **Cybersec-Pro-Archive**, a personal repository to organize and document my cybersecurity learning journey.

This repo is structured to separate **certifications**, **theoretical study materials**, and **practical exercises** to build well-rounded skills in cybersecurity.

## ðŸ“– Study Courses

The `study/` folder holds four completed theoretical courses, each with its own README and notes in PDF format:

1. Introduction to Cybersecurity   
2. Networking for Cybersecurity   
3. Endpoint Security   
4. Cyber Threat Management   
5. Kali Linux   
6. Introduction to Cryptography, Hash Functions, and Steganography
7. Python Programming language

While I have completed these courses, Iâ€™m currently **shifting my focus to practical skills**. I may revisit and add more theory materials in the future if I find valuable courses.

## ðŸ§ª Practical

The `practical/` folder is my central hub for hands-on cybersecurity learning and application. It is organized into distinct categories based on platforms or core skill sets, allowing for direct navigation:

- `tryhackme/`: Dedicated notes and write-ups from TryHackMe rooms and learning paths.
- `hackthebox/`: Documentation for Hack The Box (HTB) content, including machine write-ups and Academy module notes.
- `python/`: My learning journal and code examples for Python scripting in cybersecurity.
- `general_labs_and_tools/`: A versatile section for any hands-on work that doesn't fit neatly into the above categories (e.g., custom lab setups, miscellaneous tool notes).

> This folder is actively being populated as I focus on developing and applying practical cybersecurity skills. Practical content will be added continuously.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips and Tricks

The `tips-and-tricks/` folder contains short, practical guides for common system and security tasks.   
Each tip is saved as a numbered PDF with explanations and screenshots.

This folder is continuously updated with new helpful tips and tricks to support practical learning.

## ðŸš€ Moving Forward

With the theoretical foundation established, Iâ€™m now dedicating more time and effort to the **practical side** of cybersecurity â€” working on labs, tools, and real-world scenarios.

This practical work will help deepen my understanding and prepare me for career challenges ahead.
