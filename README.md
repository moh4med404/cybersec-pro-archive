# Cybersec-Pro-Archive

Welcome to **Cybersec-Pro-Archive**, a personal repository to organize and document my cybersecurity learning journey.

This repo is structured to separate **certifications**, **theoretical study materials**, and **practical exercises** to build well-rounded skills in cybersecurity.

---

## ðŸ“š Certifications

The `certifications/` folder contains materials for:

- **CISCO - Introduction to Cybersecurity**
- **CISCO - Junior Cybersecurity Analyst Career Path**

These certification folders include relevant resources and documents.

---

## ðŸ“– Study Courses

The `study/` folder holds four completed theoretical courses, each with its own README and notes in PDF format:

1. Introduction to Cybersecurity  
2. Networking for Cybersecurity  
3. Endpoint Security  
4. Cyber Threat Management  

While I have completed these courses, Iâ€™m currently **shifting my focus to practical skills**. I may revisit and add more theory materials in the future if I find valuable courses.

---

## ðŸ§ª Practical Labs & Tools

The `practical/` folder contains two subfolders:

- `labs/` â€” Hands-on exercises and labs for real-world cybersecurity practice.  
- `tools/` â€” Scripts and utilities to support labs and automate common tasks.

> These folders are currently being populated as I focus on developing practical skills. Practical content will be added continuously.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips and Tricks

The `tips-and-tricks/` folder contains short, practical guides for common system and security tasks.  
Each tip is saved as a numbered PDF with explanations and screenshots.

This folder is continuously updated with new helpful tips and tricks to support practical learning.

---

## ðŸš€ Moving Forward

With the theoretical foundation established, Iâ€™m now dedicating more time and effort to the **practical side** of cybersecurity â€” working on labs, tools, and real-world scenarios.

This practical work will help deepen my understanding and prepare me for career challenges ahead.
