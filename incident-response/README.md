# Incident Response

This folder contains hands-on exercises, playbooks, scripts, and documentation focused on Incident Response (IR) workflows and techniques.

## What is Incident Response?

Incident Response is the organized approach to detecting, investigating, and mitigating cybersecurity incidents. This folder aims to provide practical experience in handling incidents from initial detection through containment, eradication, and recovery.

## Tips for Effective Incident Response

- Always work in a safe, isolated environment when analyzing malware or compromised systems.  
- Prioritize containment to prevent further damage.  
- Communicate clearly with stakeholders during incidents.  
- Perform thorough root cause analysis after containment.  
- Continuously update your playbooks based on lessons learned.

## Example Workflow

1. Detect suspicious activity via logs or alerts.  
2. Triage the incident using scripts to collect system info and evidence.  
3. Analyze data to understand the scope and impact.  
4. Contain affected systems to stop the attack.  
5. Eradicate malware or unauthorized access.  
6. Recover systems and verify integrity.  
7. Document findings and improve defenses.
