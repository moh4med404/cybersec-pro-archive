"""
25 - Handling Large Log Files in Python

Demonstrates:
- Reading large files line-by-line (memory-safe)
- Filtering log entries (e.g., lines with "ERROR")
- Writing filtered results to a new file
- Counting specific events (e.g., failed logins)
- Using generators for efficient streaming
- Reading compressed .gz log files
