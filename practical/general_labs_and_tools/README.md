This folder serves as a versatile section for any hands-on work that doesn't fit neatly into the more specific categories (TryHackMe, Hack The Box, Python, Bash, PowerShell).

Content here might include documentation for custom lab setups, miscellaneous tool notes, or specific challenges from other platforms.
