# 🧪 Practical Cybersecurity Work

This folder serves as my comprehensive hub for hands-on cybersecurity learning and application. It is organized into distinct categories based on platforms or core skill sets, allowing for direct navigation to specific areas of interest.

## 📁 Folder Structure

* **`tryhackme/`**: Dedicated notes, write-ups, and captured flags from my journey through TryHackMe rooms and learning paths. This section documents my progress on the platform's structured modules, often combining theoretical concepts with practical exercises.
* **`hackthebox/`**: Contains documentation for Hack The Box (HTB) content, including retired machine write-ups, notes from HTB Academy modules, and solutions to HTB CTF challenges.
* **`python/`**: My learning journal and code examples for Python scripting in cybersecurity. This includes fundamental language concepts, network programming, automation scripts, and basic exploit development.
* **`bash/`**: Notes and practical examples for Bash scripting and advanced Linux command-line usage. Covers essential commands, scripting techniques, and shell automation.
* **`powershell/`**: Documentation of my learning in PowerShell for Windows security and administration. Includes core cmdlets, scripting for system interaction, and Active Directory-related tasks.
* **`general_labs_and_tools/`**: A versatile section for any hands-on work that doesn't fit neatly into the above categories. This might include custom lab setups, miscellaneous tool notes, or specific challenges from other platforms.


> 💡 Each relevant note and script includes usage instructions or links to necessary documentation.
