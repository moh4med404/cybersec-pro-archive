# ðŸš¨ SOC Level 1: Present Attention ðŸš¨

## I'm currently concentrating on experiential learning and finishing the course to establish a solid practical foundation.

## In addition, I'm relocating to Germany and making studying German a top priority in order to be ready for employment prospects.

## For this reason, I'm not posting thorough notes or walkthroughs here for the time being.

## In the near future, I intend to publish certifications, summaries, and content for both SOC Level 1 and Level 2 courses.
