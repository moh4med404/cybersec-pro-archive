> **Note:** These notes document my hands-on learning journey on TryHackMe, focusing on building skills in cybersecurity through practical exercises. I am currently working through the SOC Level 1 path to gain foundational knowledge and experience in Security Operations Center operations. **Prerequisites:** A basic understanding of fundamental computing principles and a broad awareness of various cybersecurity areas are recommended to complete this pathway. If you don’t have these prerequisites, it’s advised to first complete the Pre-Security and Cyber Security 101 pathways. This document is intended for personal learning, revision, and ethical skill development. All screenshots, commands, and actions are for educational purposes only.
