# Careers in Cybersecurity 

## Security Analyst Role

Security analysts are integral to constructing security measures across organizations to protect the company from attacks. Analysts explore and evaluate company networks to uncover actionable data and recommendations for engineers to develop preventative measures. This job role requires working with various stakeholders to gain an understanding of security requirements and the security landscape.

- **Responsibilities**  
  - Work with various stakeholders to analyze cybersecurity throughout the company  
  - Compile ongoing reports about the safety of networks, documenting security issues and measures taken in response  
  - Develop security plans, incorporating research on new attack tools and trends, and measures needed across teams to maintain data security  


## Security Engineer Role

Security engineers develop and implement security solutions using threat and vulnerability data—often sourced from members of the security workforce. They work to counter a broad range of attacks, including web application attacks, network threats, and evolving tactics. The ultimate goal is to maintain and adopt security measures that mitigate the risk of attack and data loss.

- **Responsibilities**  
  - Test and screen security measures across software  
  - Monitor networks and reports to update systems and mitigate vulnerabilities  
  - Identify and implement systems needed for optimal security  

## Incident Responder Role

Incident responders respond productively and efficiently to security breaches. Responsibilities include creating plans, policies, and protocols for organizations to enact during and following incidents. This is often a highly pressurized position with assessments and responses required in real-time, as attacks are unfolding. Incident response metrics include MTTD, MTTA, and MTTR — the meantime to detect, acknowledge, and recover from attacks. The aim is to achieve a swift and effective response, retain financial standing, and avoid negative breach implications. Ultimately, incident responders protect the company's data, reputation, and financial standing from cyber attacks.

- **Responsibilities**  
  - Develop and adopt a thorough, actionable incident response plan  
  - Maintain strong security best practices and support incident response measures  
  - Conduct post-incident reporting and prepare for future attacks by learning and adapting from past incidents  

## Digital Forensics Examiner Role

Responsible for using digital forensics to investigate incidents and crimes.

If you like to play detective, this might be the perfect job. If you work as part of a law enforcement department, you would focus on collecting and analyzing evidence to help solve crimes: charging the guilty and exonerating the innocent. On the other hand, if your work is defending a company's network, you will use your forensic skills to analyze incidents, such as policy violations.

- **Responsibilities**  
  - Collect digital evidence while observing legal procedures  
  - Analyze digital evidence to find answers related to the case  
  - Document your findings and report on the case  

## Malware Analyst Role

A malware analyst's work involves analyzing suspicious programs, discovering what they do, and writing reports about their findings. A malware analyst is sometimes called a reverse-engineer, as their core task revolves around converting compiled programs from machine language to readable code, usually in a low-level language. This work requires a strong programming background, especially in low-level languages such as assembly language and C. The ultimate goal is to learn about all the activities a malicious program carries out, find out how to detect it, and report it.

- **Responsibilities**  
  - Carry out static analysis of malicious programs, which entails reverse-engineering  
  - Conduct dynamic analysis of malware samples by observing their activities in a controlled environment  
  - Document and report all findings  

## Penetration Tester Role

You may see penetration testing referred to as pentesting and ethical hacking. A penetration tester's job role is to test the security of the systems and software within a company—this is achieved through attempts to uncover flaws and vulnerabilities by systemized hacking. Penetration testers exploit these vulnerabilities to evaluate the risk in each instance. The company can then use these insights to rectify issues and prevent real-world cyberattacks.

- **Responsibilities**  
  - Conduct tests on computer systems, networks, and web-based applications  
  - Perform security assessments, audits, and analyze policies  
  - Evaluate and report on insights, recommending actions for attack prevention  

## Red Teamer Role

Red teamers share similarities to penetration testers, with a more targeted job role. Penetration testers look to uncover many vulnerabilities across systems to keep cyber-defence in good standing, whilst red teamers are enacted to test the company's detection and response capabilities. This job role requires imitating cyber criminals' actions, emulating malicious attacks, retaining access, and avoiding detection. Red team assessments can run for up to a month, typically by a team external to the company. They are often best suited to organisations with mature security programs in place.

- **Responsibilities**  
  - Emulate the role of a threat actor to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities, maintain access and avoid detection  
  - Assess organisations' security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response procedures  
  - Evaluate and report on insights, with actionable data for companies to avoid real-world instances
