# Training Impact on Teams


### Understanding the Impact of Cyber Security Training

How would you master any skill? By practice and training. Cyber security is no different. Nobody is born a cyber security expert; everyone needs to gain the relevant skills and work diligently to keep them up to date and build upon them.

However, practising what you learn in cyber security has certain requirements.  
- For example, it usually involves setting up a computer lab environment to ensure that the setup won‚Äôt harm production systems.  
- This is why **training platforms are indispensable** in your journey to becoming a ‚Äúmaster.‚Äù

You might have heard the saying:  
> ‚ÄúAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,‚Äù  
and cyber security is no exception.  
- When responsible for system security, it is **better to learn in a training environment** than during a live incident.  
- Proper training increases the quality of the cyber security team‚Äôs work and reduces the likelihood of incidents.

- **Organisational Impact of Training**  
  The real power of training from an organisation‚Äôs perspective is that it increases the team‚Äôs capacity *without* hiring additional team members.  
  - It prepares the team to handle future incidents proactively.  
  - Instead of learning tools and techniques *during* a cyber attack, trained teams come prepared.

- **Talent Development**  
  Training enables organisations to:  
  - Hire junior staff and help them ramp up quickly  
  - Reduce the burden on senior staff from repeatedly teaching the same material

- **Creating a Common Baseline**  
  Centralised training establishes a shared foundation to:  
  - Assess employee skills and knowledge  
  - Replace vague labels like ‚Äújunior‚Äù or ‚Äúsenior‚Äù with measurable capabilities  
  - Make informed decisions when assigning tasks  
  - Provide a clear development path for career growth  


## Cyber Security Training for Large Organisations

For smaller teams, off-the-shelf training is usually the most logical choice.  
However, if your team exceeds a certain size‚Äîtypically beyond twenty employees‚Äîor your training needs are highly specific, it makes sense to **customise existing training** to fit your organisation‚Äôs requirements.

TryHackMe enables this through its **Content Studio**, a feature that allows you to:
- Modify existing training modules  
- Create new content tailored to your organisation‚Äôs needs and priorities  

This level of customisation **increases the effectiveness** of cyber security training across the workforce.

- **Integration at Scale**  
  Large corporations typically don‚Äôt want a standalone training solution‚Äîthey need one that:
  - Integrates with their existing software ecosystem  
  - Supports **SSO (Single Sign-On)** for seamless user access  
  - Offers well-documented **APIs** for automation and system integration  

These functionalities ensure that training blends smoothly into daily operations without friction.

## Cyber Security Training Investment Proposal


### Executive Summary

As cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, maintaining a well-trained security workforce is no longer optional‚Äîit is essential. Investing in cyber security training empowers your team to respond faster, prevent incidents, and protect business assets more efficiently.

This proposal outlines the financial and strategic benefits of training investments and presents a compelling return on investment (ROI) analysis.

### Business Case

#### Objective
To upskill our cyber security team of 10 employees by enrolling them in structured training programs that enhance productivity, threat response, and risk mitigation capabilities.

#### Justification
- Cyber threats are evolving rapidly; outdated skills increase risk exposure.
- Trained professionals reduce the likelihood and impact of security incidents.
- Training boosts team morale, job satisfaction, and retention.

### Financial Impact of Training

#### Scenario Details:
- **Team Size:** 10 Cyber Security Employees  
- **Annual Cost per Employee:** $80,000  
- **Assumed Productivity Improvement from Training:** 4%  
- **Training Cost per Employee:** $500  

#### Calculations:
- **Annual Team Salary Cost:** $800,000 (10 √ó $80,000)  
- **Estimated Productivity Gain:**  
  $32,000 = 10 √ó 4% √ó $80,000  
- **Training Cost (Total):**  
  $5,000 = 10 √ó $500  
- **Return on Investment (ROI):**  
  640% = ($32,000 / $5,000) √ó 100  

#### Interpretation:
For every dollar invested in training, the company can expect a return of $6.40 in productivity gains.

### Strategic Benefits

- **Faster Incident Response:** Trained teams detect and contain threats more quickly.
- **Reduced Downtime:** Minimized disruptions lead to greater business continuity.
- **Improved Risk Posture:** Better understanding of vulnerabilities leads to proactive mitigation.
- **Standardised Skillsets:** Centralised training creates a measurable baseline for staff capabilities.

### Proposal

We propose enrolling the team in a structured cyber security training platform such as **TryHackMe**, offering:
- Hands-on labs
- Skill assessments
- Customisable training paths (via *Content Studio*)
- Enterprise features like SSO and API integration

### Conclusion

An initial investment of **$5,000** will yield approximately **$32,000** in annual productivity gains‚Äîa **640% ROI**‚Äîwhile significantly enhancing our organisation‚Äôs cyber resilience. We strongly recommend approving this training initiative as a strategic and financially sound decision.

### Next Steps

- Approve training budget allocation of $5,000  
- Select training provider (e.g. TryHackMe Enterprise)  
- Roll out training plan within the next quarter  
- Monitor performance impact over six months  

## Vendor Selection

Now that we‚Äôve explored the importance of cyber security training, the next step is selecting the **right training vendor**. This decision plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of your training program and your team‚Äôs overall growth.

To assist in this process, consider the following **key questions** during vendor evaluation:

- **Who are you buying the training for?**  
  Understand the target audience clearly‚Äîroles, responsibilities, and goals.

- **What are the experience, background, and topics relevant to your employees?**  
  Ensure that the platform matches your team's current skill level and future learning objectives.

- **Has the vendor worked with similar organisations?**  
  Relevant industry or company-size experience is a strong indicator of success.

- **What is the content‚Äôs breadth, depth, and quality for the topics you care about?**  
  Check whether the platform covers beginner to advanced topics in your focus areas (e.g., network security, cloud, red teaming, etc.).

- **Can users learn, train, and practice on a single platform?**  
  A unified learning environment helps increase engagement and ensures practical, hands-on learning.

- **What is the cost versus benefit?**  
  While the CFO may focus on cost, it's critical to emphasise that cyber security employee training costs are typically **dwarfed** by the productivity and risk-reduction benefits.

üìå **Conclusion:**  
Answering these questions thoughtfully will guide you to make an **optimal vendor selection**‚Äîone that meets your company‚Äôs needs, elevates your team‚Äôs skills, and supports your long-term security strategy.
