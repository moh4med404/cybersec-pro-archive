# Scripts and Tools

This folder contains reusable scripts, tools, and utilities used across different cybersecurity domains.

## Structure

Scripts and tools are organized by domain either as subfolders or with clear filename prefixes to help identify their purpose:

- `pentest_` — Penetration Testing related scripts and tools  
- `ti_` — Threat Intelligence tools and scripts  
- `malware_` — Malware Analysis scripts and utilities  
- `forensics_` — Digital Forensics tools and scripts  
- `ir_` — Incident Response related scripts (if applicable)

## Usage

- Use this folder as your central repository for all code snippets, automation scripts, and custom tools you create or modify.  
- Keep scripts well-documented and organized by domain or functionality.  
- Feel free to add new scripts in the appropriate domain or create a new subfolder if the script covers a broader purpose.
